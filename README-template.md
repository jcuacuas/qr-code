## My process

I built this QR code component on desktop first using HTML and CSS. I added media queries to have it fit on a mobile screen.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
.qr-code__container {
    background: var(--white);
    border-radius: 20px;
    margin: 5rem auto;
    padding: 2rem 0;
    width: 355px;
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.35);
}
```

I made this component in the simplest way I know, using the margin-inline: auto; property. It doesn't take much to get the box centered properly.  

### Continued development

I am not sure if defining the width propety on my component is best practice. Maybe in a future project, I could use the percentage (%) value for the width property.

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow CSS Generator]](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - This helped me with the box shadow property. I don't have that much experience creating box shadows from scratch.
